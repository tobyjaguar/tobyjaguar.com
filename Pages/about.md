## About Me

<img src="../assets/_landing.jpg">

My primary focus these days is on software development for blockchain applications. Currently fulltime on <a href="https://smartpiggies.com">SmartPiggies</a>.

I have spent a lot of time researching the cryptocurrency space, i.e.
digital assets, DLT, blockchain space. 
          
In another life I created content for live performance
applications. I have a couple of art degrees, and enjoy exploring conversations in emerging cultural trends. One day I will make a podcast.

Buy a TOBY token from the <a href="https://tokenshop.tobyjaguar.com" target="new">Token Shop</a> and let me buy it back from you over a good pu'er.
