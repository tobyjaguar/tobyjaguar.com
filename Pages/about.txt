Title: About Me

My primary focus these days is on web3-full-stack, dApp development.
I have spent a lot of time researching the cryptocurrency space, i.e.
digital assets, DLT, blockchain space. There was a time when it was
just referred to as the bitcoin space, but times have certainly changed.
          
In another life I created content for live performance
applications. I have a couple of art degrees, and enjoy exploring conversations
in emerging cultural trends. One day I will make a podcast.
